# SPICED Week02: Predict survival on the Titanic 

## Project Summary

In this project I built and trained several classification models on the famous [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview) data set, in order to predict whether a passenger survived the tradegy or not.

Steps to achive the desired goal:
- Explore the Titanic dataset
- Train a Logistic Regression classification model
- Create features using one-hot encoding
- Calculate the train and validation accuracy
- Train a Random Forest classification model
- Submit the predictions to Kaggle

The competition on Kaggle was already closed, but I submitted my result anyway and ended up with a decent result:

## Project Milestones

### Data preprocessing pipeline

The heart of the project is the extensive preprocessing pipeline, which is adapted according to the classification model.
